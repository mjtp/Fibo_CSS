	<p>And blowing into <mark>maximum warp speed,</mark> you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. <b>Travel time to the nearest starbase?</b> Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? This is not about revenge. This is about justice. <em>Commander William Riker</em> of the Starship Enterprise.</p><small><em>Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training.</em> Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - <b>'Commander'</b>? We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise.</small>
